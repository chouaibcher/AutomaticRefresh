# Automatic Refresh for AADL3

* Alert sound upon successful page load to notify you.
* Stops refreshing automatically after successful page load.

**Requirements:**

* Firefox web browser
* Python 3

**Setup:**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chouaibcher/aadl3.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Contributing:**
